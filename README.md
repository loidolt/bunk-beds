## General Info

These bunk beds feature a rounded, kid-safe design with a modern aesthetic in a 90-degree configuration. This design is focused on being useful long term, so the lower bed is entirely separate from the main structure to allow it to be used as a loft bed with a desk or chairs underneath once the kids transition to separate rooms.

The top bed is twin size and features integrated lights for reading, USB ports for charging, and is rated to hold a full-size adult.

The ladder is removable, to gain easier access to the storage cubbies. The storage cubbies are weight-bearing and are intended to be used as the primary method of entry to the top bunk once the kids are older and no longer need the ladder.

The lower bed also features lights and a cubby with integrated USB ports for charging. All 4 lights are individually controllable and fully RGB through ESPHome and HomeAssistant allowing full control through the smart home. Buttons are also provided for basic functions so a smart home command is not always required.

The entire assembly comes apart in three sections for transport, the sections are connected to one another with 1/4-20 machine screws and threaded inserts.

## Notes

The lights are not shown in these photos, they were installed afterwards in the long retangular slots.
